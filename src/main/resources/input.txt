Now when you first visit the site, it will ask you for your username, then give you a personalized message. You can change the name any time you like by pressing the button. As an added bonus, because the name is stored inside localStorage, it persists after the site is closed down, keeping the personalized message there when you next open the site! When you run the example and get the dialog box that prompts you to enter your user name, try pressing the Cancel button. You should end up with a title that reads "Mozilla is cool, null". This is because when you cancel the prompt, the value is set as null, a special value in JavaScript that basically refers to the absence of a value.
